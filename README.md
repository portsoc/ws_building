ws_building
===========

An example of a gulp build file, with
some rudimentary HTML & JS app.

Check out the source:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/portsoc/ws_building.git
npm install
```

Observe that the build folder has not been downloaded.

If you've not installed gulp, you can install it globally (so you can use it in any folder thus):

```shell
npm install -g gulp
```

After running the gulp file&hellip;

```shell
gulp
```
&hellip;the build folder is present and populated.
